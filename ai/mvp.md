### Main problem
Manually creating high-quality flashcards is time-consuming, which discourages the use of spaced repetition, an effective learning method.

### Minimum set of features
- AI-generated flashcards based on entered text (copy-paste)
- Manual flashcard creation
- Viewing, editing, and deleting flashcards
- Simple user account system for storing flashcards
- Integration of flashcards with a ready-made repetition algorithm

### What is NOT included in the MVP
- Own advanced repetition algorithm (like SuperMemo, Anki)
- Import of multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Sharing of flashcard sets between users
- Integrations with other educational platforms
- Mobile applications (web only for now)

### Success criteria
- 75% of flashcards generated by AI are accepted by the user
- Users create 75% of flashcards using AI
